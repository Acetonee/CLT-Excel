## FAQ
Q: What is this?  
A: This is an Excel spreadsheet that visuallises the Central Limit Theorem with just 1 click!    

Q: Why is this?  
A: Inspired by LCE in Queen's College, Hong Kong, I just made this as I can't seem to find a similar solution easily and decided to code it myself as an afternoon project. It's good for visuallisations in classrooms as it is illustrative and requires no installation.    

Q: When is this?  
A: Today. But also, the future.    

Q: How is this?  
A: VBA scipts that I just learnt for this sole purpose.  
Why do none ever ask how I am? I cri ;_;    

Q: Who is this?  
A: It's a me. Acetonee. And also you, if you use this.    

Q: Where is this?  
A: On Github's cloud servers. And also your computer's drive if you download it.    

Q: IT DOESN'T WORK!  
A: Make sure you have Macros enabled.  
Excel 2016 or Excel 365 versions are tested and preferred.  
If ""Error 1004"" is prompted, it is a known bug in Excel. Restarting Excel usually solves the issue.  
If these doesn't solve it, try crying alone at a corner of your bedroom and question your very own existance.    

Q: Is it safe to use?  
A: Yes it's completely safe. This programme is completely open source. Source code can be viewed under the Developer tab->Macros.    

Q: Why did you make this? _ has done it better!  
A: I figure if others are in the rare instance of needing one as well, putting it out and saving them a bit of time would perhaps make the world a pinch less miserable.    

Q: There's a issue with _ / Can you add _?  
A: Put that under the issues tab on the project's github page and I may do it when I'm in the right mood.    

Q: MY DAD OWNS GOOGLE  
A: That's a stupid question. I'm gonna pretend that you asked a smart one. I make small projects every now and then. Most of them are kinda niche and don't end up on the internet. These things I do are probably gonna haunt me later in my life and I'd probably regret posting to what's practically an infinite archiving machine.    

Q: What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?  
A: African or European?
